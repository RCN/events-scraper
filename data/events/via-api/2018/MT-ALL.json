      "MONTANA GRAVEL CHALLENGE\r\nApril 13 – 15 | Missoula, Montana\r\nThe Montana Hell Ride and The Rocky Mountain Roubaix are joining forces and presenting a multi-day gran fondo style gravel event inspired by the Spring Classics: The Montana Gravel Challenge.\r\nThe Montana Gravel Challenge is a coming together of The Cycling House and Competitive Timing.  We think what’s best for the Montana Hell Ride and Rocky Mountain Roubaix is to have them be on one big gravel weekend.  Stage 2 will be the Montana Hell Ride with a new format and course. Stage 3 will be the Rocky Mountain Roubaix with a new longer course. We’ve added a stage 1 time trial as an extra piece to offer a zero barrier event for beginners and recreational riders, while also offering racers an early separation before stage 2 and 3.  We’d like riders of all abilities to try the challenge.  It’s setup in a grand fondo style format, so everyone gets a time and folks can go for racing the event, riding the event, or just going for a completion.  Stage 2 and 3 will have a recreation wave that starts 1 minute later then the first wave perfect for those riding with friends or trying to stay out of a larger group.  The hardest part about this event will be finishing all three stages, not being fast at all three stages.",
    "course":
      "Stage 1 6 time trial is all dirt roads.  It’s climbs just over 600 feet in 4 miles.  It’s more gentle terrain then straight uphill.  First 1.5 miles is low 1% grade offering a great warmup for the last 2.5 miles. You get in to really pretty forests and some super small/cool dirt roads that don’t see much life.\r\n\r\nStage 2 is the Montana Hell Ride.  It’s actually three 15 miles laps on a new circuit in the 9 mile area.  Each lap is a tale of two sides.  Half the lap is wide, smooth, and fast dirt roads.  The other half is hilly, rough, narrow, and adventurous.  Race or ride with your buds, should be a memorable day.  There will also be a Strava KOM every time of the climb.\r\n\r\nStage 3 is the Rocky Mountain Roubaix.  Longer than last year with new course for 2018 but with all the beloved Roubaix aspects still about equal parts road and dirt, moderate climbing, and a whole lotta grit.  It’s straight up your favorite Petty Creek Road and then out the 9 mile drainage with a lollipop loop and then back the way you came.",
