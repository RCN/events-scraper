      "This is a 40 mile ride with approx. 4,900ft of climbing starting and ending at Sunrise Farm.",
    "course":
      "Roads are mostly smooth dirt but small rocks and shallow pot holes exist. Road gearing with climbing gears to tackle short 15% sections and extended 8-10% sections are recommended. 36x28 gears will work for most, although some champs could get away with 39x28.",
