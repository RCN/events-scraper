      "The Little 150 is a unique road race possessing a blend of teamwork, road endurance fitness, track racing power, and enjoyment for spectators and racers alike. With deference to the revered Little 500 at Indiana University, we have modified their format because we don\\&#39;t all enjoy racing in cinder on our friend\\&#39;s single speed, track bike. That said, the appeal of bonding with some buddies and trying to rip the legs off your competitors is what we are all about at the Little 150. Bring your fastest road bike, a head wired with racing strategy, a few good teammates and put some hurt on. Your team can be composed of 2-5 racers. ",
