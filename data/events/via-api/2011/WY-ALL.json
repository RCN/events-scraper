      "The McCullough Peaks Wild Horse Century is a very unique event to benefit the wild mustangs of the McCullough Peaks  outside Cody Wyoming.  The joint sponsorship of Friends of a Legacy ( FOAL) and Park County Pedalers (PCP) will offer a century bicycle ride on September 10th, 2011.  Proceeds from this ride will go towards the care of the wild horses.  Options for a shorter ride will also be provided.\r\n \r\nWith a little luck you will be able to see the wild horses right from your bicycle seat.  Rest stops will be set up to enable viewing of the horses while you gather nourishment for the next leg of the ride.  The ride will travel around the BLM lands that are home to these magnificent mustangs.   Besides the century ride there will also be other options and things to do.  Special accommodations are also being provided by the Cody Legacy Inn, right across the street from the starting point.",
    "course":
      "The ride will follow established roads from which wild horses are seen year round.  Rest stops will be offered along the way as will full SAG support.  The FOAL organization will host the rest stops and offer viewing stations and experts to spot the wild horses.  FOAL has land which is accessible from the highway and is also adjacent to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands where the wild horses live.\r\n\r\nIn summary the ride will have three options depending on how much you wish to ride.  Each option will leave from the Absaroka Bicycle Shop in  Cody, Wyoming and follow Route 14-16-20 heading east along the BLM lands.  One option will be to turn around once reaching Burlington, Wyoming and returning the way you came for about 60 miles.  The other options continue North on highway 32 just past Burlington, Wyoming.  The next option is to turn left onto highway 295 and cut over to Highway 14 and continue back to Cody.  This would give you about 82 miles   The full ride would continue to Byron, Wyoming and then return to Cody thru Powell Wyoming on Highway 14.  This gives you a full century. \r\n\r\nPost ride picnic will be held at Beck Lake behind Absaroka Bicycles.",
