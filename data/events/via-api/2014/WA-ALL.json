      "The Pipeline Gravel Grinder is a family friendly cycling event.  The purpose of this event is to give riders an accessible entry into the exciting world of mixed road surface events.  There are three groups &#x28;waves&#x29; that riders can choose from: a fast group, a moderate group and a family group.  Riders can choose from these three groups depending on their comfort and ability level on mixed paved and gravel roads.  The gravel segments are not technical and can be ridden using road bikes.  ",
    "course":
      "The course is a 10 mile point-to-point route that starts at the White River School Parking lot off the Foothills trail and then heads out to the unpaved Pipleane Trail to Lake Tapps.  The course is mostly ribinou &#x28;dirt road&#x29; and 25c tires are advised.  A course map is here http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/384648268.  Rules of the road apply, however most of the course is on restricted pipeline access road with limited interactions with cars.  The fast and moderate paced groups will return via Sumner Buckley Highway.  Family participants will return using the course and avoiding the highway.",

      "Three self-seeded groups will leave at different times..  The first wave is for faster riders and will leave at 9:00am,   A strava segment will be set-up so that riders can compare their times if they choose.   The second wave is intended for riders who want to ride at a slower pace or have not ridden ribinou roads and want to get an easy introduction.  The final wave is a family ride and is intended for kids.   Children under 10 must be accompanied by an adult.  Riders who register in the A or B race may ride the Family wave as well with a child at no cost.",
